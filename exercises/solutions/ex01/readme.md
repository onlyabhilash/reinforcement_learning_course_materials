# Use jupyter notebook in poolroom

Open a terminal and execute the following command:
```bash
source /upb/scratch/users/c/cbj/py37/bin/activate
```

(A backup anaconda is under `source /upb/users/l/ldrude/public/share/anaconda3/bin/activate`.)

This will setup anaconda in the current terminal.
Go to the directory where your excersises are (Use `cd <folder>` to change the directory and `ls` to show the content of the current directory).

Launch the jupyter server with the following command:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

# Use jupyter notebook on own machine

The recommended way is to install jupyter notebooks through Anaconda:

[Install Anaconda instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

Having installed anaconda, you should be able to evoke jupyter notebook servers as mentioned above.

# Use jupyter notebook on foreign machines/servers

If you find your own machine not performant enough for your needs, please consider one of the following options.
