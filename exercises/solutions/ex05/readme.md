# Exercise 05
In this exercise we will revisit the included `racetrack_environment` to have a look at temporal difference (TD) algorithms. 
## Tasks:
  1. policy evaluation using TD learning
  2. on-policy epsilon-greedy control using TD learning
  3. off-policy epsilon-greedy control using TD learning &rarr; Q-learning
  4. using double Q-learning in stochastic environments
