# Exercise 09
This exercise investigates the usage of function approximators in RL prediction tasks, which allows to estimate the state value when the state space is continuous. 
`OpenAI's` MountainCar is considered as the environment.
## Tasks:
  1. linear function approximation and enhancement by feature engineering
  2. optimally fitted function approximation using recursive least squares TD
  3. nonlinear function approximation using artificial neural networks (this serves as a demonstation example for the usage of `Tensorflow` in RL)
