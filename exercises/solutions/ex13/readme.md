# Exercise 13
In this additional exercise we will investigate the state-of-the-art algorithms deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and proximal policy optimization (PPO) using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and investigate their performance in interaction with the [Goddard's rocket problem](https://github.com/osannolik/gym-goddard). 
There, the optimal thrust profile for a vertically ascending rocket has to be found in order for it to reach the maximum possible altitude.
In the end we will highlight examples using a common RL-toolbox, e.g. [Stable Baselines 3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3).
## Tasks:
  1. Write a DDPG algorithm using PyTorch
  2. Write a PPO algorithm using PyTorch
