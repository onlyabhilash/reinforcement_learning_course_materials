# Exercise 03
This exercise introduces the fundamentals of dynamic programming based on our knowledge about MDP.
## Tasks:
  1. policy evaluation for a stochastic policy
  2. exhaustive policy search and it's computational effort
  3. value iteration within a deterministic environment
  3. value iteration within a stochastic environment
