# Exercise 11
In this exercise we will implement eligibility traces into our learning algorithms for the MountainCar example. 
## Tasks:
  1. Sarsa(&lambda;) using artifial neural networks
  2. true online Sarsa(&lambda;), which makes use of a linear function approximator
  3. comparison of algorithms with and without eligibility traces
