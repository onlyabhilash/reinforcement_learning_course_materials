Recap the \hl{update targets} for the incremental prediction methods \eqref{eq:inc_impl_MC_pred_non_stat}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Monte Carlo: Builds on the complete sampled return series
	\begin{equation}
		g_{k:T} = r_{k+1}+\gamma r_{k+2}+\gamma^2 r_{k+3}+\cdots+\gamma^{T-k-1}r_T .
	\end{equation}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $g_{k:T}$ denotes that all steps until termination at $T$ are considered to derive an estimate target adressing step $k$.
	\end{itemize}\pause
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	\item TD(0): Utilizes a one-step bootstrapped return
	\begin{equation}
		g_{k:k+1} = r_{k+1}+\gamma \hat{v}_{k}(x_{k+1}) .
	\end{equation}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item For TD(0), $g_{k:k+1}$ highlights that only one future sampled reward step is considered before bootstrapping.
		\item $\hat{v}_{k}$ is an estimate of $v_\pi$ at time step k.
	\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{$n$-step state-value prediction target}
Now, the target is generalized to an arbitrary $n$-step target:
\begin{equation}
		g_{k:k+n} = r_{k+1}+\gamma r_{k+2}+\cdots+\gamma^{n-1} r_{k+n}+\gamma^{n} \hat{v}_{k+n-1}(x_{k+n}) .
\end{equation}
\end{block}\pause
\begin{itemize}
	\item Approximation of full return series truncated after $n$-steps.
	\item If $k+n \geq T$ (i.e., $n$-step prediction exceeds termination lookahead), then all missing terms are considered zero.
\end{itemize}\pause
\begin{block}{$n$-step TD}
The state-value estimate using the $n$-step return approximation is
\begin{equation}
	\hat{v}_{k+n}(x_k) = \hat{v}_{k+n-1}(x_k) + \alpha \left[g_{k:k+n} - \hat{v}_{k+n-1}(x_k)\right], \quad 0\leq k < T.
\end{equation}
\end{block}\pause
\begin{itemize}
	\item Delay of $n$-steps before $\hat{v}(x)$ is updated.
	\item Additional auxiliary update steps required at the end of each episode.
\end{itemize}

\frame{\frametitle{Convergence}

\begin{theo}{Error reduction property}{error_reduction_property}
The worst error of the expected $n$-step return is always less than or equal to $\gamma^n$ times the worst error under the estimate $\hat{v}_{k+n-1}$:
\begin{equation}
	\max_x \left|\El{G_{k:k+n}|X_k = x}{\pi} - v_\pi(x)\right| \leq \gamma^n \max_x \left|\hat{v}_{k+n-1}(x) - v_\pi(x)\right| .
\end{equation}
\end{theo}\pause
\begin{itemize}
	\item Assuming an infinite number of steps/episodes and an appropriate step-size control according to \theoref{theo:converge_TD_zero}, $n$-step TD prediction converges to the true value.\pause
	\item In a more practical framework with limited number of steps/episodes:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Choosing the best $n$-step lookahead horizon is an engineering degree of freedom.
		\item This is highly application-dependent (i.e., no predefined optimum).
		\item Prediction/estimation errors can remain due to limited data.
	\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item For on-policy control by Sarsa action-value estimates are required. 
	\item Recap the one-step action-value update as required for 'Sarsa(0)':
	\begin{equation}
		\hat{q}(x_k, u_k) \leftarrow \hat{q}(x_k, u_k) + \alpha\left[\underbrace{r_{k+1}+\gamma\hat{q}(x_{k+1}, u_{k+1})}_{\mbox{\footnotesize target }\normalsize g} - \hat{q}(x_k, u_k)\right] .

\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}

		\begin{equation}
		g_{k:k+n} = r_{k+1}+\gamma r_{k+2}+\cdots+\gamma^{n-1} r_{k+n}+\gamma^{n} \hl{\sum_u \pi(u|x)\hat{q}_k(x,u) }.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Recap on Off-Policy Learning  with Importance Sampling}
Consider two separate policies in order to break the on-policy optimality trade-off:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \hl{Behavior policy} $b(u|x)$: Explores in order to generate experience.
		\item \hl{Target policy} $\pi(u|x)$: Learns from that experience to become the optimal policy.\pause
		\item Important requirement is \hl{coverage}: Every action taken under $\pi$ must be (at least occasionally) taken under $b$, too. Hence, it follows:
	\begin{equation}
		\pi(u|x) > 0 \Rightarrow b(u|x) > 0 \quad \forall \, \left\{x\in\mathcal{X}, u\in\mathcal{U}\right\} .
	\end{equation}
	\end{itemize}\pause
\begin{block}{Importance sampling ratio (revision from \defref{defi:import_sampl_ratio})}
The relative probability of a trajectory under the target and behavior policy, the importance sampling ratio, from sample step $k$ to $T$ is:
\begin{equation}
	\rho_{k:T}=\frac{\prod_k^{T-1} \pi(u_k|x_{k})p(x_{k+1}|x_{k}, u_{k})}{\prod_k^{T-1} b(u_k|x_{k})p(x_{k+1}|x_{k}, u_{k})}=\frac{\prod_k^{T-1} \pi(u_k|x_{k})}{\prod_k^{T-1} b(u_k|x_{k})} .
\end{equation}
\end{block}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Transfer Importance Sampling to $n$-Step Updates %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Transfer Importance Sampling to $n$-Step Updates}
For a straightforward \hl{$n$-step off-policy TD-style update}, just weight the update by the importance sampling ratio:
\begin{align}
	\hat{v}_{k+n}(x_k) &= \hat{v}_{k+n-1}(x_k) + \alpha \hl{\rho_{k:k+n-1}}\left[g_{k:k+n} - \hat{v}_{k+n-1}(x_k)\right], \quad 0\leq k < T, \notag \\
										\rho_{k:h}&=	\prod_k^{\min (h,T-1)}\frac{\pi(u_k|x_{k})}{b(u_k|x_{k})} .\label{eq:rho_off_policy_TD}
\end{align}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\rho_{k:k+n-1}$ is the relative probability under the two polices taking $n$ actions from $u_k$ to $u_{k+n}$.
\end{itemize}\pause
Analog, an \hl{$n$-step off-policy Sarsa-style update} exists:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\hat{q}_{k+n}(x_k,u_k) &= \hat{q}_{k+n-1}(x_k,u_k) \\&+ \alpha \hl{\rho_{k+1:k+n}}\left[g_{k:k+n} - \hat{q}_{k+n-1}(x_k, u_k)\right], \quad 0\leq k < T.
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Here, $\rho$ starts and ends one step later compared to the TD case since state-action pairs are updated.

The 1-step tree-backup target is equal to that of expected Sarsa:
		\begin{equation}
		g_{k:k+1} = r_{k+1}+\gamma \sum_{u} \pi(u|x_{k+1}) \hat{q}_k(x_{k+1}, u), \quad k<T-1 .
		\end{equation}\pause
In the 2-step case, the probability of being in $x_{k+1}$ and applying the sampled action $u_{k+1}$ weights the second node (if $k<T-2$):
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
		g_{k:k+1} &= r_{k+1}+\gamma \sum_{u \neq u_{k+1}} \pi(u|x_{k+1}) \hat{q}_{k+1}(x_{k+1}, u)\\
							&+\gamma \pi(u_{k+1}|x_{k+1})\left(r_{k+2}+\gamma \sum_{u} \pi(u|x_{k+2}) \hat{q}_{k+1}(x_{k+2}, u)\right)\\
							&= r_{k+1}+\gamma \sum_{u \neq u_{k+1}} \pi(u|x_{k+1}) \hat{q}_{k+1}(x_{k+1}, u)+\gamma \pi(u_{k+1}|x_{k+1})g_{k+1:k+2} .
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Extending the previous scheme delivers a general definition of the tree-backup target in a recursive form:
\begin{block}{$n$-step tree-backup return}
For $k < T-n$ and $n \geq 2$ the $n$-step tree-backup return is:
\begin{equation}
	g_{k:k+n} = r_{k+1}+\gamma \sum_{u \neq u_{k+1}} \pi(u|x_{k+1}) \hat{q}_{k+1}(x_{k+1}, u)+\gamma \pi(u_{k+1}|x_{k+1})g_{k+1:k+n} .
	\label{eq:target_tree_backup}
\end{equation}
\end{block}\pause
\begin{itemize}
	\item Due to recursive formulation, calculation starts at the bottom node.\pause
	\item State-action value update is realized again via the $n$-step Sarsa rule (for $0\leq k < T$):
\begin{equation*}
	\hat{q}_{k+n}(x_k,u_k) = \hat{q}_{k+n-1}(x_k,u_k) + \alpha \left[g_{k:k+n} - \hat{q}_{k+n-1}(x_k, u_k)\right].
\end{equation*}

\frame{\frametitle{$n$-Step $Q(\sigma)$ Target (1)}
Firstly, we rewrite the $n$-step tree backup \eqref{eq:target_tree_backup}
\begin{equation*}
	g_{k:k+n} = r_{k+1}+\gamma \sum_{u \neq u_{k+1}} \pi(u|x_{k+1}) \hat{q}_{k+1}(x_{k+1}, u)+\gamma \pi(u_{k+1}|x_{k+1})g_{k+1:k+n}
\end{equation*}
using $\overline{v}_k(x_{k})=\sum_u \pi(u|x)\hat{q}_{k}(x_{k}, u)$ for the time horizon $h=k+n$:
\begin{block}{Rewritten $n$-step tree backup target}
\vspace{-0.4cm}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	g_{k:h} &= r_{k+1}+\gamma \overline{v}_{h-1}(x_{k+1})-\gamma \pi(u_{k+1}|x_{k+1})\hat{q}_{h-1}(x_{k+1}, u_{k+1}) \\&+ \gamma \pi(u_{k+1}|x_{k+1})g_{k+1:h}\\
					&= r_{k+1}+\gamma\pi(u_{k+1}|x_{k+1})\left(g_{k+1:h}-\hat{q}_{h-1}(x_{k+1}, u_{k+1})\right)+\gamma \overline{v}_{h-1}(x_{k+1})
\end{split}

\end{block}

\frame{\frametitle{$n$-Step $Q(\sigma)$ Target (2)}
Similarly, a recursive formulation for the off-policy importance sampling  target \eqref{eq:rho_off_policy_TD} can be found:
\begin{block}{Rewritten $n$-step importance sampling target}
\vspace{-0.4cm}
\begin{equation}
	g_{k:h} = r_{k+1}+\gamma\rho_{k+1}\left(g_{k+1:h}-\hat{q}_{h-1}(x_{k+1}, u_{k+1})\right)+\gamma \overline{v}_{h-1}(x_{k+1}) .
	\label{eq:n_step_sampling_Q_sigma}
\end{equation}
\end{block}\pause
Inspecting \eqref{eq:n_step_tree_backup_rewritten} for the expectation-based target and \eqref{eq:n_step_sampling_Q_sigma} for the sample-based target, \hl{$Q(\sigma)$ is a linear weighting in terms of the probability $\pi(u_{k+1}|x_{k+1})$ and the importance sampling ratio $\rho_{k+1}$}:
\begin{block}{$n$-step $Q(\sigma)$ target}
\vspace{-0.4cm}
\small
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	g_{k:h} &= r_{k+1}\\&+\gamma\hl{\left(\sigma_{k+1}\rho_{k+1}+(1-\sigma_{k+1})\pi(u_{k+1}|x_{k+1})\right)}\left(g_{k+1:h}-\hat{q}_{h-1}(x_{k+1}, u_{k+1})\right)\\&+\gamma \overline{v}_{h-1}(x_{k+1}) .

\frametitle{Summary: What You've Learned Today}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $n$-step updates allow for an intermediate solution in between temporal difference and Monte Carlo:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $n=1$: TD as special case,
		\item $n=T$: MC as special case.
	\end{itemize}\pause
	\item The parameter $n$ is a delicate degree of freedom:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It contains a trade-off between the learning delay and uncertainty reduction when considering more or less steps.
		\item Choosing it is non-trivial and sometimes more art than science.
	\end{itemize}\pause
	\item Tree backups are an alternative for off-policy learning without importance sampling.\pause
	\item $Q(\sigma)$ updates unify sample-based and expectation-based approaches:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A continuous intermixing of sampling and expectation is possible.
		\item Here, $\sigma_k \in [0,1]$ can be adjusted in every step.
		\item Adds flexibility but obviously also complexity.
		\item Again, optimal parameter choice is not straightforward.
