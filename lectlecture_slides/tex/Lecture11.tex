	\item Recall $n$-step bootstrapping updates:
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		g_{k:k+n} &= r_{k+1}+\gamma r_{k+2}+\cdots+\gamma^{n-1} r_{k+n}+\gamma^{n} \hat{v}_{k+n-1}(\bm{x}_{k+n}),\\
		g_{k:k+n} &= r_{k+1}+\gamma r_{k+2}+\cdots+\gamma^{n-1} r_{k+n}+\gamma^{n} \hat{q}_{k+n-1}(\bm{x}_{k+n}, u_{k+n}) .
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}\pause
	\item Motivation: retrieve bootstrapped estimates between one-step updates and Monte Carlo.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Use $n$ as degree of freedom to find the learning optimum.
	\end{itemize}\pause
	\item However, there are two significant drawbacks of $n$-step bootstrapping:
	\vspace{-0.4cm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Delay: we are looking $n$-steps into the future and, therefore, have to wait $n$-steps before we can perform the update.
		\item Memory: we have to store $n$ transitions until we can process them.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}\pause
\begin{block}{Goal of todays lecture}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Find an algorithm with the same flexibility as $n$-step bootstrapping.
	\item Avoid the $n$-step disadvantages (delay, memory demand).
\end{itemize}

	\begin{equation}
		g_{k:h}^\lambda = (1-\lambda)\sum_{n=1}^{h-k-1}\lambda^{(n-1)}g_{k:k+n} + \lambda^{h-k-1}g_{k:h}\,.
		\label{eq:lambda_return_trunc}

	\item Horizon $h$ divides continuing tasks in rolling episodes.\pause
	\item The truncated $\lambda$-return \eqref{eq:lambda_return_trunc} can be used analogously to $n$-step returns in semi-gradient TD updates (cf. \algoref{algo:Semi_gradient_TD_nstep}).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Eligibility Trace (1) %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Eligibility Trace (1)}
Why is the exponential weighting particular suitable for TD($\lambda$)?\pause
\begin{itemize}
	\item Because we can easily implement this in a recursive fashion.\pause
\end{itemize}
\begin{block}{Exponential smoothing filter}
Let $x_k$ be an arbitrary signal sampled at equally distributed time steps $k$. Then, the filtered signal $y_k$ with an exponential window function of past observations is
\begin{equation}
	y_k = \beta x_k + (1-\beta)y_{k-1}, \quad k> 0 \quad \mbox{and} \quad y_0=x_0
	\label{eq:exp_smoothing_filter}
\end{equation}
with $\beta$ being the smoothing factor.  
\end{block}\pause
\begin{itemize}
	\item Above is a simple recursive exponential smoothing filter which converges for $k>>1$.
\end{itemize}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Eligibility Trace (2) %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Eligibility Trace (2)}
With TD and function approximation 
\begin{itemize}
	\item the \hl{eligibility trace $z_k\in\mathbb{R}^\zeta$} is a vector with same dimensions as $\bm{w}$:
	\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\bm{z}_{0}&=0,\\
	\bm{z}_k &=\gamma\lambda\bm{z}_{k-1}+\nabla_{\bm{w}}\hat{v}(\bm{x}_k,\bm{w}_k).
\end{split}	
\label{eq:Elig_trace}
\end{equation}
	\item It tracks which components of $\bm{w}$ have contributed to recent state valuations. Here, \hl{$\lambda$} is also called the \hl{trace-decay parameter}.\pause
\end{itemize}
Further remarks:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\bm{z}_k$ can be interpreted a short-term memory while $\bm{w}_k$ is the long-term memory within the learning process of $\hat{v}$.\pause
	\item Comparing \eqref{eq:Elig_trace} with the filter \eqref{eq:exp_smoothing_filter} it becomes obvious that $\bm{z}$ is not an idealized exp. filtered form of $\nabla_{\bm{w}}\hat{v}$.\pause
	\item Consider case $k\rightarrow\infty$ and $\nabla_{\bm{w}}\hat{v}(\bm{x}_k,\bm{w}_k)=\nabla_{\bm{w}}\hat{v}=\mbox{const.}$, then $\bm{z}$ is only a bias-free  trace of $\nabla_{\bm{w}}\hat{v}$ in the TD sense if $\lambda = 1$:
	\begin{equation*}
		 \bm{z}=\frac{\nabla_{\bm{w}}\hat{v}}{1-\gamma\lambda}.
	\end{equation*}
	\end{itemize}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}
	\item Consider linear function approximation with a single state being the feature vector
		\begin{equation*}
			  \hat{v}(x_k, w) = x_k w \quad \rightarrow \quad \nabla_w \hat{v}(x_k, w) = x_k .
		\end{equation*}
	\item For illustration purpose we assume that $w$ is constant.
	\item Below is an example for the eligibility trace with $\lambda = 0.9, \gamma=1$.

	\item If $h<T$ then we can perform online updates since $\bm{w}$ is changed within an episode.\pause

General trade-off regarding the truncated $\lambda$-returns (forward view):
\begin{itemize}
	\item If $n$ is small: delay and memory demand are low.
	\item If $n$ is high: approximation of offline $\lambda$-returns is more accurate.
\end{itemize}\pause
Idea to solve this compromise: \hl{redoing updates}.
\begin{itemize}
	\item If new data is available, we go back and redo all previous updates.
	\item Reuse data samples $\bm{\mathcal{D}}_k\sim\left\langle \bm{x}_k, r_k, \bm{x}_{k+1}\right\rangle$.\pause 
	\item Update parameter vector $\bm{w}_k^h$ at $k$-th time step up to horizon $h$.

%% Transfer for Action Values %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Transfer for Action Values}
First, transfer truncated $\lambda$-returns to action values (forward view):
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
		g_{k:h}^\lambda &= (1-\lambda)\sum_{n=1}^{h-k-1}\lambda^{(n-1)}g_{k:k+n} + \lambda^{h-k-1}g_{k:h},\\
		g_{k:k+n} &= r_{k+1}+\gamma r_{k+2}+\cdots+\gamma^{n-1} r_{k+n}+\gamma^n\hat{q}(\bm{x}_{k+n}, u_{k+n}, \bm{w}_{k+n-1}).
\end{split}	
\end{equation}\pause
From that, the forward view \hl{offline $\lambda$-return} update for $\hat{q}$ is:
\begin{equation}
	\bm{w}_{k+1} = \bm{w}_k+\alpha\left[g_k^\lambda - \hat{q}(\bm{x}_k, u_k, \bm{w}_k)\right]\nabla_{\bm{w}}\hat{q}(\bm{x}_k, u_k\bm{w}_k) .
	\label{eq:offline_lambda_return_action}
\end{equation}\pause
The backward view approximation known as \hl{Sarsa($\lambda$)} is then:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
		\delta_k &=r_{k+1} + \gamma \hat{q}(\bm{x}_{k+1}, u_{k+1}, \bm{w}_k) -\hat{q}(\bm{x}_{k}, u_{k}, \bm{w}_k),\\
		\bm{z}_k &=\gamma\lambda\bm{z}_{k-1}+\nabla_{\bm{w}}\hat{q}(\bm{x}_k, u_k, \bm{w}_k),\quad \bm{z}_{0}=0,\\
		 \bm{w}_{k+1} &=  \bm{w}_k + \alpha\delta_k\bm{z}_k .
\end{split}	
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Likewise TD($\lambda$) for state values, Sarsa($\lambda$) is not an exact backward view implementation of the offline $\lambda$-return algorithm \eqref{eq:offline_lambda_return_action}.\pause
 \item To improve the Sarsa($\lambda$) performance we again have two options:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Redoing updates: Online Sarsa($\lambda$) (e.g., with non-linear function approximation, direct transfer from \eqref{eq:online_lambda_return_update}),
	\item or re-use the true online implementation with linear approximators for action values.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}\pause
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The true online Sarsa($\lambda$) updates are analog to TD($\lambda$), but the features additionally contain action information $\tilde{\bm{x}}=\bm{f}(\bm{x},u)$ :
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	  \bm{z}_k &= \gamma\lambda\bm{z}_{k-1} + (1-\alpha\gamma\lambda\tilde{\bm{x}}\T_k\bm{z}_{k-1})\tilde{\bm{x}}_k,\\

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Summary: What You've Learned Today}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Multiple $n$-step return estimates can be weighted to form a compound update (adds more degrees of freedom).\pause
	\item $\lambda$-returns use this idea with exponentially-decaying weights.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item However, like $n$-step bootstrapping also $\lambda$-returns are forward-viewing and, therefore suffer from increased memory demand and delay times.
	\end{itemize}\pause
	\item Using eligibility traces we introduce backward-facing algorithms:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The trace is acting as a short-term memory.
			\item How important was a parameter for the current value update? 
		\end{itemize}\pause
	\item TD$(\lambda)$	is using the traces for state-value prediction.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Applicable with general nonlinear function approximation.
		\item However, not an exact representation of $\lambda$-returns.
	\end{itemize}\pause
	\item Only if linear function approximation is used, true online TD$(\lambda)$ allows identically backward-facing updates as $\lambda$-returns. \pause
	\item Transfer to action values by Sarsa is straightforward.
\end{itemize}
