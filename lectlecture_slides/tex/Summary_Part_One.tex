\begin{enumerate}
	\item Estimating and comparing value functions
	\item Backing up values along actual or possible state trajectories
	\item Usage of GPI mechanism to maintain an approximate value function and policy trying to improve each of them on the basis of the other
\end{enumerate}

%% Outlook %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Outlook}
First part of the course:
\begin{block}{Reinforcement learning on small finite action and state spaces}
The problem space is such small that RL methods based on look-up tables are applicable.
\end{block}\pause
\vspace{0.5cm}
Second part of the course::
\begin{block}{Reinforcement learning using function approximators}
The problem space is either continuous or contains an unfeasible large amount of discrete state-action pairs. Value estimates, models or explicit policies stored in look-up tables would let the memory demand explode. Modifications and extensions of available RL algorithms using function approximators are required.    
\end{block}
